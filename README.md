# Senior Project Proposal

**"rifffz"**, a resource for music creation and theory

## The Problem(s)

There are two major problems that this project aims to solve.

1. The first is that musicians don't have a feasible way of sharing their musical creations (specifically the written music and not audio) with others online. This project will utilize the html5 canvas element to provide a way for users to create and share sheet music within a purposefully built online community. It will be implemented with a "following" mechanic that will help promote collaboration with other users and foster a more social music creation process.

2. Another aspect of the project is geared to people who don't have any musical experience and wish to learn some basic principles. There are other projects that attempt to solve this issue, but I feel that this could be much improved with a type of achievement system that challenges and rewards users as they progress. I hope to build this system in an open way that encourages others to contribute to similar tutorials that focus on more advanced topics, so that the project can become a great resource for musical education.

## Outline

### Expected Deliverable

My goal is to create a web application that attempts to solve these problems.

### Technology

Here is a list of some specific technology that will be used heavily:

* **Rails 3.1** -- the ruby-on-rails web application framework
* **Vexflow** -- javascript library for html canvas sheet music representation

### General Schedule/Milestones

#### Winter 2012

Start of project. I will first focus on the educational elements of the website. I'll probably start off with creating some of the major design elements, so that I can quickly prototype ideas and get a feel for the direction of the project. I'll also start work on the backend models for this section of the app.

#### Spring 2012

Hopefully, I'll be able to start the social music creation and sharing aspect to the site by this time, depending on how the progress on the educational component has been going.

## Equipment

No special equipment will be needed--most of the technology that will be used is open-source and freely available.

## Criteria Satisfaction

### Independence

I will be working on this project by myself for my senior project. The web application is the discrete measure of the project's progress. Criteria for success will be met if I have met the goals of establishing a helpful resource for sharing and learning music online. Failure will be the result of not meeting these goals.

### Ownership

The success and failure of this project is solely dependent on me.

### Background Research

As far as the educational component of the project, I have researched the [treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/) web application that achieves a similar goal with coding and design rather than music. It is part of the inspiration for this project.

As far as the creation aspect to the project, I have only been able to find sites that allow users to share audio versions of their music (like [ultimate-guitar](http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/) for guitar tabs), and not the actual visual source material.

New technologies that I will have to familiarize myself with are [coffee-script](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) for writing cleaner javascript code. I'm already pretty familiar with [ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), so that shouldn't be a major obstacle in the development process.

The [vexflow](http://vexflow.com/) library will be a tool that I will have to become familiar with during the development process.

### Creativity

Currently, there is no website that solves these problems. I am attempting to do something that hasn't done before in a hopefully inventive way. I think that the way in which I'm bringing musical content to the web is very unique and creative.
